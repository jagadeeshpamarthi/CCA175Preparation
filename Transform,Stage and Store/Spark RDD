RDD : 
Resilient
Distributed
DataSet

RDD is extension of scala List data set , difference b/w both is RDD is :
1  in-memory
2  Distributed
3  DataSet

creating RDD :
val scalaList = (1 to 100).toList
val scalaRDD = sc.parallelize(scalaList)             // .parallelize function converts a list into RDD

RDD is falut-tolarent,high availability as it is resilient(RDD process stroed in multiple executors)
RDD is stored in Distributed manner
