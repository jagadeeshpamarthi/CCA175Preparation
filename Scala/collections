In Scala Collections are catagerized into 3 types 
1 seq                         //all sequential datasets come under seq(Array,List etc) allows duplicates
2 set                         //NO duplicates (set)
3 Map                         // key value pair data sets come under this (Map)

above three are Interfaces and has their own concreat class , parent of all these interfaces is iterator,its parent is travesable 

Tupels :
val tupel = (1,2,4.1,5)       //dataset which implements product and serializeble and to we need to access the elements with there location only
scala>tupel._3
output : 4.1
